### Odin Recipes Project

This website clone of [[www.allrecipes.com]] is **The Odin Project** assignment
all content including image files and rest are directly taken from **allrecipes**

Although, it was an html assignment, according to The Odin curriculum, for me it was more of a css exercise. Learned a lot about flexbox, a,span and img tags as well as how CDN-s work.
