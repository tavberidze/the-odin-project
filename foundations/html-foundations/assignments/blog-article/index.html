      <p class="paragraph-text">After 80 million views on Netflix, The Minimalists' first documentary, Minimalism: A
        Documentary About the
        Important Things, is now on YouTube. Directed by Emmy-nominated filmmaker Matt D'Avella, Minimalism examines the
        simple lives of minimalists from all walks of life—families, entrepreneurs, architects, artists, journalists,
        scientists, and even a former Wall Street broker—all of whom are living meaningfully with less.</p>

      <p>Inside Minimalism is a collection of 50 short and relatable essays on simple living by a small
        team of writers from different backgrounds, but who all share a deep appreciation for minimalism as a way of
        life. It is not a guide book or rule book. Rather, we simply hope it will inspire, motivate, and encourage you.
